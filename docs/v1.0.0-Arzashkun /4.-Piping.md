A mesh with only one component is rarely useful. The true power of FMesh emerges when multiple components are connected using **pipes**. By connecting components, you enable them to exchange signals and tackle complex problems in small, manageable steps. This idea is not unique to FMesh—it draws inspiration from concepts in object-oriented and functional programming. However, FMesh implements it in a simpler, more transparent way.

Pipes are intentionally simple: they merely connect two ports. In fact, "pipe" is an abstraction—there is no dedicated "pipe" entity in the source code. Instead, pipes are represented as groups of outbound [ports](https://github.com/hovsep/fmesh/blob/main/port/port.go#L21). Each pipe connects exactly one output port to exactly one input port. While we initially explored more flexible "any-to-any" pipes, this approach introduced unnecessary complexity and was ultimately avoided.

This design doesn't limit your ability to create ***one-to-many*** or ***many-to-one*** connections. Such configurations are achieved using multiple pipes, each maintaining the simplicity of a single output-to-input link.

## One to one connection

To demonstrate how pipes work, let’s start with a simple example:

```go
//Connect output port "o1" of component "c1" to input port "i1" of component "c2"
c1.OutputByName("o1").PipeTo(
		c2.InputByName("i1"),
	)
```
**Semantics**: All signals put to the output port ***o1*** of ***c1*** will be transferred to the input port ***i1*** of ***c2***.

>[!IMPORTANT]
Signals are always copied by reference in FMesh. Instead of creating physical copies, FMesh moves pointers between ports. This means signals are removed from the source port's buffer and appended to the destination port's buffer.

## One-to-Many Connections

To create one to many connection we create multiple pipes from the same source port:

```go
//Create three pipes from "o1"
c1.OutputByName("o1").PipeTo(
		c2.InputByName("i1"),
                c3.InputByName("i2"),
                c4.InputByName("i3"),
	)
```

**Semantics**: All signals put on ***o1*** will be copied by reference to all three destination ports (***i1***,***i2*** and ***i3***).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Signals are always copied by reference. To avoid unexpected behavior:
>* Keep signals immutable whenever possible.
>* Design components as pure functions to minimize side effects.
>* If necessary, create a deep copy of the signal before modifying it.

Understanding how pointers work in Go is crucial for working with FMesh pipes effectively

## Many-to-One Connections

Creating a **many-to-one** connection is equally straightforward using the same API:

```go
// Connect multiple source ports to the same destination port
c1.OutputByName("o1").PipeTo(sink.InputByName("i1"))
c2.OutputByName("o1").PipeTo(sink.InputByName("i1"))
c3.OutputByName("o1").PipeTo(sink.InputByName("i1"))
```

**Semantics**: This configuration creates three pipes from the output ports of different components (***c1***, ***c2***, and ***c3***) to the same input port (***i1***) of the ***sink*** component. All signals from the respective source ports will appear on ***i1***

You can find similar examples in [this integration test](https://github.com/hovsep/fmesh/blob/main/integration_tests/piping/fan_test.go).

## Cyclic Connections

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bec7fc4-12ec-4583-99ec-611d4a7ad88d)

In some scenarios, you may need to create a **cyclic connection**, where a component’s output port is connected to one of its own input ports. This is fully supported and a common pattern in FMesh. Just as functional programming favors recursion over loops, cyclic pipes enable components to "self-activate."

Example:

```go
// Connect the output port "o1" to the input port "i1" within the same component
c1.OutputByName("o1").PipeTo(c1.InputByName("i1"))
```

**Semantics**: The component will reactivate itself in the next cycle, provided there is at least one signal on any of its input ports. This allows the component to control when to activate and how many cycles to execute before stopping

For a practical example, check out [the Fibonacci example](https://github.com/hovsep/fmesh/blob/main/examples/fibonacci/main.go#L40), which demonstrates how cyclic pipes can be used to implement recursive logic.

That’s all you need to know about pipes in FMesh. Pipes are the backbone of communication between components, enabling you to build modular, efficient, and highly flexible systems. With the fundamental building blocks of ports and pipes, you can create a wide range of powerful and versatile patterns, including:

* **Event Bus**: Centralized communication for decoupled components.
* **Fan-In**: Merging multiple inputs into a single unified output.
* **Fan-Out**: Distributing a single input to multiple destinations.
* **Broadcast**: Simultaneously transmitting a signal to all connected receivers.
* **Chain of Responsibility**: Passing signals through a series of components, each capable of handling or forwarding them.
* **Load Balancer**: Distribute incoming signals across multiple components to balance workload.
* **Round-Robin Distributor**: Sequentially route signals to multiple components in a cyclical order.
* **Pipeline**: Process data through a series of components, each performing a distinct transformation or operation.
* **Aggregator**: Collect signals from multiple sources and combine them into a single output.
* **Filter**: Route signals selectively based on specific criteria or conditions.
* **Splitter**: Divide a signal into smaller parts and distribute them to different components for parallel processing.
* **Priority Queue**: Process signals based on their priority levels, ensuring high-priority tasks are handled first.
* **Dead Letter Queue**: Capture signals that cannot be processed by any component for later analysis or retries.
* **Observer Pattern**: Notify multiple components of changes in a shared signal or state.
* **State Machine**: Use cyclic connections to implement state transitions driven by signals.
* **Pub-Sub (Publish-Subscribe)**: Allow components to subscribe to specific topics or signals and receive updates dynamically.
* **Circuit Breaker**: Monitor signals and temporarily halt processing when a failure threshold is reached.
* **Rate Limiter**: Throttle the flow of signals to ensure components are not overwhelmed.
* **Retry Logic**: Automatically reprocess failed signals after a specified delay or condition.

These are just a few examples. The simplicity and flexibility of FMesh make it possible to design and implement countless other patterns tailored to your specific needs.
