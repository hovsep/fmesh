You can think of FMesh as an orchestrator or computational graph, designed to run components—whether all of them or just a select few—based on a structured approach. Execution cannot happen arbitrarily; it must follow specific scheduling rules. These rules ensure that components are activated in the correct order, maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your mesh. Understanding how FMesh schedules components is crucial for building a well-functioning and reliable system.

Execution in FMesh is organized into **Activation Cycles**, which represent the process of activating a group of components. Each activation cycle is structured into distinct phases to ensure proper execution:

## Phases of an Activation Cycle

1. **Determining Scheduled Components**
    *  In this phase, FMesh identifies all components that are ready to be activated.
    *  A component is considered ready if at least one of its input ports contains signals (i.e., is not empty).
    *  All components identified during this phase are considered **scheduled for activation**.

2. **Activating Scheduled Components**
    *  All scheduled components are activated concurrently, with each running in a separate goroutine.
    *  This concurrency is safe and efficient since components in FMesh are designed to avoid shared state.
    *  Activation doesn’t always guarantee the invocation of a component's activation function. In some cases, activation may fail before reaching the function (e.g., due to a chained error).
    *  Regardless of the outcome, FMesh records the activation result, which could include:

       *  **Normal Execution**: The activation function completes successfully.
       *  **Error Return**: The function returns an error.
       *  **Panic**: The function panics.

       The mesh itself remains robust and does not crash due to individual component failures. Depending on the configuration, the mesh may stop or continue execution.

3. **Draining Phase** 
     *  Once all scheduled components are activated, the draining phase begins:
         *  **Input Ports**: All input ports of activated components are cleared, as their signals have been processed and are no longer needed.
         *  **Output Ports**: Signals residing on the output ports of activated components are flushed into their respective pipes. These signals are then delivered to the input ports at the other ends of the pipes. This ensures that signals are effectively transferred and ready for the next cycle.

**Special case**: If a component is in a ["waiting"](https://github.com/hovsep/fmesh/wiki/5.-Component#waiting-for-inputs) state (expecting more input), its input ports may not be cleared.
Additionally, the component’s output ports are never flushed while it is waiting. The exact behavior is determined by the component's implementation.

After completing the draining phase, FMesh proceeds to the next activation cycle, repeating the process. This iterative execution continues until the mesh reaches a terminal state, at which point processing concludes.


## Terminal States in FMesh

FMesh execution concludes when the mesh reaches a terminal state. The following scenarios define these terminal states:

* **Chained Error Propagation**  
A chained error is propagated to the mesh, indicating that a critical issue occurred at the signal, port, or component level, making further execution invalid.

* **Cycle Limit Reached**  
FMesh can be configured to terminate after a specified number of activation cycles. This is particularly useful for debugging or testing purposes. Example configuration:

```go
fm := fmesh.NewWithConfig("limited mesh", &fmesh.Config{
    CyclesLimit: 10, // Limit to 10 activation cycles
})
```
* **Time Limit Exceeded**  
  FMesh can be configured to terminate after a specified duration of time. This is useful for long-running simulations . Example configuration:

```go
fm := fmesh.NewWithConfig("limited mesh", &fmesh.Config{
    TimeLimit: 10 * time.Second, // Mesh will be forcelly stopped after reaching 10 seconds duration
})
```


* **No Components Activated in the Last Cycle**  
If no components are activated during an activation cycle, it signifies that all signals have been processed, and the mesh has completed its execution naturally. At this point, it is time to extract the final results.

* **Error Handling Strategy: StopOnFirstErrorOrPanic**  
If the error handling strategy is set to StopOnFirstErrorOrPanic, the mesh will terminate as soon as any component encounters an error or panic during activation.

* **Error Handling Strategy: StopOnFirstPanic**  
If the error handling strategy is configured as StopOnFirstPanic, the mesh will halt immediately upon encountering a panic in any component, ignoring other types of errors.


Error handling strategy can be set as follows:
```go
fm := fmesh.NewWithConfig("durable", &fmesh.Config{
    ErrorHandlingStrategy: fmesh.IgnoreAll, //Errors and panics will be tolerated
})
```

## Error Handling Strategies in FMesh

FMesh provides flexible error handling strategies to control how the mesh responds to errors and panics during component activation. The available strategies are:

* **StopOnFirstErrorOrPanic**  
The mesh stops execution as soon as an error or panic occurs in any component's activation function.
This strategy ensures that any unexpected or invalid state is caught early, preventing further processing.

* **StopOnFirstPanic**  
The mesh ignores errors but halts immediately if a panic occurs during a component's activation.
This strategy is useful when errors are recoverable but panics indicate critical failures that require immediate attention.

* **IgnoreAll**  
The mesh continues running regardless of whether components finish their activation functions with errors or panics.
This strategy is ideal for scenarios where robustness is prioritized, and individual component failures do not impact overall processing.

Each strategy offers different levels of fault tolerance and control, allowing you to tailor the mesh's behavior to suit your application's requirements.
