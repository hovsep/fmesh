### Mesh Configuration

By default, you can create an F-Mesh instance using the standard constructor:

```go
fm := fmesh.New("simple mesh")
```

This initializes the mesh with a set of reasonable default settings.

However, if you need more control over the configuration, you can use the specialized constructor:

```go
fm := fmesh.NewWithConfig("simple mesh", config)
```

You can customize the following settings via the config parameter:

 - **ErrorHandlingStrategy** – Defines how F-Mesh reacts to errors and panics, determining whether execution should stop.
 - **CyclesLimit** – Sets a limit on the number of activation cycles.
 - **TimeLimit** – Sets a time constraint on mesh execution.
 - **Debug** – Enables debug mode when set to true, logging useful information about each activation cycle.
 - **Logger** – Specifies the logger instance to be used by F-Mesh and its components.
